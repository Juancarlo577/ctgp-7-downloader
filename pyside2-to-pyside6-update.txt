I have replaced pyside2 with pyside6 to add support to other architecture types like arm64 and other stuff that pyside6 support -juancarlo577

files ive updated goes as follows
./CTGP7UpdaterApp/ui_main.py - pyside2.Qgui.Qfont.setweight to pyside6.Qgui.Qfont.weight
other files just needed to replace pyside2 with pyside6 not much needed a huge change.
