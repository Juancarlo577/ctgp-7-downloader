Modules needed: `pyside6`, `psutil`, `urllib3`

(Should you not have these modules, install them with `pip install pyside6 psutil urllib3`)

Simply run `main.py`.
On Linux, you might need to call it in a terminal using `python main.py`.

changes added:
updated pyside2 to pyside6
which adds support to arm64 and other stuff that pyside6 supports.
